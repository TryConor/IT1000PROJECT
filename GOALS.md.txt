# GOALS

The purpose of this webpage is to introduce you, the reader, to some of the goals that I have set for myself as a student.

## What I hope to achieve with my time at Mizzou
- The purpose of my education in Information Technology will ultimately be to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from *The University of Missouri Columbia*

- Additionally, using this degress I would like to find a job suitable for my expertise that complements my strengths as an employee and as an individual. 
- By my senior year I hope to be in a position where I might be able to participate in an internship program or co/op depending on my situation.
- Most importantly, I hope to maintain and build connections from within the University and College of Engineering that will benefit my career and personal goals later in life
