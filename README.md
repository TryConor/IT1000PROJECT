The purpose of this webpage is to introduce you, the reader, to me the student!

## A little bit about me
My name is Conor McLaughlin and I am a sophmore currently enrolled at the **University of Missouri Columbia**. I am studying Information Technology within their engineering program. I am an active member of the *Mizzou Engineering Student Council* and I love staying active and participating in class.

If someone were to ask me what my favorite things about Mizzou were I would give them a list.
