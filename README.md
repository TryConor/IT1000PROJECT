The purpose of this webpage is to introduce you, the reader, to me the student!

## A little bit about me
My name is Conor McLaughlin and I am a sophmore currently enrolled at the **University of Missouri Columbia**. I am studying Information Technology within their engineering program. I am an active member of the *Mizzou Engineering Student Council* and I love staying active and participating in class.

------------------------

If someone were to ask me what my favorite things about Mizzou were I would give them a list.

Here is an example of some of the work I have completed in this class
```
//function fizzbuzz() {
    var display = document.getElementById('display');
    var displayHTML = "";
    for (i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
            //displayHTML += "<p>FizzBuzz</p>";
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            displayHTML += "<p>Fizz</p>";
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            //displayHTML += "<p>Buzz</p>";
        } else {
            displayHTML += "<p>" + i + "</p>";
        }
    }
}

	display.innerHTML = displayHTML;
}
```
